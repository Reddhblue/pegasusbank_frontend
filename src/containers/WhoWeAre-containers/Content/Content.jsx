        <h2>THE BANK</h2>
        <p>
          We founded Universal Banks to set a new standard in investment
          management: curated, comprehensive, simple-to-use—and fit for you,
          with the belief that we all get ahead when nobody gets left behind. We
          are here for the millions of who've long been ignored — or even taken
          advantage of — by traditional banks. We are rewiring the banking
          system to make money more approachable and to give consumers a more
          accessible and sustainable path to their goals. We offer banking
          services that are delivered over the internet, giving you the ability
          to do some or all of your banking on your computer, tablet, or
          smartphone.

        <h3>Universal Banks Setting the New Standard in Wealth Management</h3>
        <p>
          It's time for banking system management to come out of the stone age.
          Universal Banks is a private wealth experience — fit for you. There
          are some investors that truly stand apart from the rest — iconic
          names, prescient thinkers, and prolific researchers. We make it our
          job to find those investment partners, and work with them to make
          their funds available to you. We partner with investment firms to
          lower barriers to investing in alternative asset classes (like private
          real estate, private credit, and more), while also selectively
          developing our own proprietary products to help meet our clients
          needs. But all of that means nothing if the right mix and weight of
          these strategies don't help meet your goals. Being a universalbanks
          client means being treated with personalized, high-touch support and
          targeted investing guidance that revolves around your needs and
          preferences. And finally, in a time when online investing content and
          anonymous “advice” forums abound, universal banks is a place for you
          to ask questions and get answers, straight from those managing your
          money. We aim to reimagine investing — from the very products that are
          available, to the client experience from beginning to end. Some
          elements of our offering may be familiar only to the wealthy few such
          as access to blue-chip investment partners and the new asset classes
          enabling additional ways to diversify and manage risk.
